## Overview

ROS packages intended to ease interaction between ABB robot controllers and ROS-based systems, by providing *ready-to-run* ROS nodes.

  <i>Connecting ABB robots, people and ROS systems together.</i>
</p>

The included (*principal*) packages are briefly described in the following table:

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [abb_rws_state_publisher](abb_rws_state_publisher) | Provides a ROS node that continuously polls an ABB robot controller for system states, which then are parsed into ROS messages and published to the ROS system. |
| [abb_rws_service_provider](abb_rws_service_provider) | Provides a ROS node that exposes ROS services, for *discrete interaction* with an ABB robot controller, like starting/stopping the `RAPID` program and reading/writing of IO-signals. |
| [abb_egm_hardware_interface](abb_egm_hardware_interface) | Provides ROS nodes for:<br><ul><li>Running a [ros_control](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control)-based hardware interface, for *direct motion control* of ABB robots (via the *Externally Guided Motion* (`EGM`) interface).</li><li>Automatically stopping `ros_control` controllers when `EGM` communication sessions ends *(a user-provided list can specify controllers that are ok to keep running*).</li></ul>***This package is only recommended for advanced users.*** |

Please see each package for more details (*e.g. additional requirements, limitations and troubleshooting*).

It is recommended to utilize the `RobotWare` [StateMachine Add-In](https://robotapps.robotstudio.com/#/viewApp/c163de01-792e-4892-a290-37dbe050b6e1) to ease the setup of the ABB robot controller system. The `StateMachine Add-In` is optional, however, without it, the driver nodes will only be able to provide basic interaction with ABB robots.

## Build Instructions

It is assumed that [ROS has been installed](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) on the system in question.

*Note that the included packages have mainly been tested with ROS Melodic (on both Ubuntu and Windows).*

### catkin_tools

As some of the dependencies of this driver are plain CMake packages (instead of Catkin packages), they cannot be built using vanilla [catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin), but require the use of either `catkin_make_isolated` or [catkin_tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
The instructions in the rest of this section will assume `catkin_tools` will be used.
In case of using `catkin_make_isolated`, be sure to update commands where necessary.

As workspaces cannot be built with both vanilla `catkin` and `catkin_tools`, if you already have a workspace and would like to *add* the packages of this driver to that workspace, be sure to clean the workspace prior to building it, as you will encounter errors otherwise.

### vcstool

The instructions below assume [vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) is installed.
Refer to [How to install vcstool?](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool#how-to-install-vcstool) in the `vcstool` readme for more information on how to install it on various OS.

### Building the Packages

The following instructions assume that a [Catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace) has been created at `$HOME/catkin_ws` and that the *source space* is at `$HOME/catkin_ws/src`. Update paths appropriately if they are different on the build machine.

The following instructions should build the main branches of all required repositories on a ROS Melodic system:

```bash
# Change to the root of the Catkin workspace.
cd $HOME/catkin_ws
mkdir -p src

# Use vcstool to clone all required repositories into the 'src' space.
vcs import src --input https://github.com/ros-industrial/abb_robot_driver/raw/master/pkgs.repos

# Check build dependencies.
# First update the local rosdep database.
rosdep update

# And then ask rosdep to install any missing dependencies for us.
# NOTE: This may install additional packages, depending on the software installed
#       on the machine. Be sure to check each command rosdep wants to run.
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro melodic

# Finally build the workspace (using catkin_tools).
catkin build
```

If no errors were reported as part of the `catkin build` command, the build has succeeded and the driver should now be usable.

### Activating the Workspace

Finally, activate the workspace to get access to the packages just built:

```bash
$ source $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

At this point all packages should be usable (ie: `roslaunch` should be able to auto-complete package names starting with `abb_..`). In case the workspace contains additional packages (i.e.: not from this repository), those should also still be available.

## Bringup Examples

See [abb_robot_bringup_examples](abb_robot_bringup_examples) for some basic examples of how to configure, launch and use the included ROS nodes.
